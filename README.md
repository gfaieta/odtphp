odtphp - ODT document generator using PHP
======

Description
----------------

OdtPHP is a PHP library designed to use OpenDocument file as a template for PHP. It's a kind of PHPLib for OpenOffice document.

This is an unofficial updated fork from the official odtphp project.

This project aims to bring some community updates (including my own) that will never make it into the official project since it is now abandoned.

This project is currently used in real applications, such as Dolibarr. As thus, the project is pretty much stable and used by hundreds of users.

Installation
----------------

You only need to copy all the files inside the 'library' folder, and then include 'odf.php'.

From there, simply instanciate the Odf class, and then use the methods (commented in the sourcecode).

[TODO: More details on usage should be added here]
